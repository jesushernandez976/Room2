          <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">
            Access Code Programming was founded in Chicago, driven by a passion
            for both programming and creativity. Our journey began with the
            belief that technology should not only solve problems but also
            inspire and elevate the way we interact with the digital world. With
            a foundation rooted in programming expertise and an eye for design,
            we set out to create innovative solutions that seamlessly combine
            functionality and artistry. From the very beginning, our mission has
            been to help businesses harness the power of the web, delivering
            unique, tailored digital experiences that make an impact. With years
            of experience in the industry, coupled with formal education in
            Information Technology and Software Development, we have studied and
            mastered the web development and design concepts. Our team has
            continually honed their skills, ensuring that we stay at the
            forefront of technology and creativity. Today, Access Code
            Programming continues to grow, fueled by a passion for creativity, a
            deep understanding of the craft, and a relentless pursuit of
            excellence.

                <p class="testimonial-text">"Jesus with Access Code Programming was great to work with. He was able to build a website that went above and beyond what I was expecting. I needed something that stood out and he absolutely crushed it. Not only that, but he got the job done faster than expected. 
                    Whenever I reached out to him with a question or needed something fixed he would help me with that. Highly recommend to anyone that wants to take their website and business to the next level."</p>
